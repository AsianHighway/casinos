MORE than just another directory of casinos in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. With the Chinese quickly constructing 100+ local casinos, and supporting structures such as hotels, dining, shopping etc, together we will attempt to guide / lead these facilities by offering the best features and functions you have seen online for casino related websites and directories. Providing complete info about services and facilities being offered, hotel booking options, and promoting who has the highest paying games or tournaments, standing out from other "directories" so Casino Management will be happy to pay our fees. Until we start driving traffic, and showing with Google Analytics (etc.) how our service has benefitted a facility, no casino will want to purchase our services. www.Sihanoukville-Casinos.com aka www.casinos-shv.com 

The documentation is currently located at www.sihanoukville-casinos.com aka https://casinos-shv.com/blog/ and once you've helped out we will consider moving into aws.amazon, https://www.alibabacloud or a similar service provider. You are asked to contribute profitable ideas to help us begin earning income. Here is an mp3 to assist you: https://gf.asianhighway26.com/  Can an Affiliate Marketing link be used here, and what do we offer for bringing in cash? 

This file can be updated as necessary, perhaps via Google Docs https://docs.google.com/document/d/1weLTXX17PyMr_K0eHp6-o4yCeRuU3m-ydW_CGcaLzmE/edit?usp=sharing  BECAUSE Google says anyone with this link can comment. Please use English only. 

You can register into /wp-admin and tell me your username so you can have Admin status. This allows you do DO SOME MAGIC and see who else is there. Please use your common sense and help design a project that almost forces wealthy casino owners to become involved with us.

It is best you put your comments in Google Docs so others can reply, because usually I’m offline doing other tasks or chores. I don’t check the emails each day, either. SMS asking me to reply to some URGENT question and I’ll come online. From your SMS I can try getting into WhatsApp to read the message you want me to reply to. You are invited to even leave a voice message if desired. 
REMEMBER when some wealthy Chinese Casino Operator says “There are already casino directories so why should we use YOURS?”
