MORE than just another directory of casinos in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. With the Chinese quickly constructing 100+ local casinos, and supporting structures such as hotels, dining, shopping etc, together we will attempt to guide / lead these facilities by offering the best features and functions you have seen online for casino related websites and directories. Providing complete info about services and facilities being offered, hotel booking options, and promoting who has the highest paying games or tournaments, standing out from other "directories" so Casino Management will be happy to pay our fees. Until we start driving traffic, and showing with Google Analytics (etc.) how our service has benefitted a facility, no casino will want to purchase our services. 

The documentation is currently located at www.sihanoukville-casinos.com aka https://casinos-shv.com/blog/ and once you've helped out we will consider moving into aws.amazon, https://www.alibabacloud or a similar service provider.
